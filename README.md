<h1>Search breweries using Open Brewery DB!</h1>
<h3>This mini project uses the open brewery db to show a list of breweries based on the city the user types in.</h3>

<h4>I would love to add more functionality to this project including clearing the list items once the user types in a different city
and formatting the data so that it shows the address as well.</h4>
